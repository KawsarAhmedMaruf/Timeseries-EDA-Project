The dataset used for the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is related to air quality measurements. It contains several columns with information about the air quality at different time points.

The columns in the dataset are as follows:

- 'year_month_day_hour': This column represents the date and time of the measurement.
- 'No': This column appears to be an identifier or serial number for each data entry.
- 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour': These columns provide separate information about the year, month, day, and hour of each measurement.
- 'PM2.5': This column represents the measurement of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.
- 'PM10': This column represents the measurement of particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less.
- 'SO2', 'NO2', 'CO', 'O3': These columns represent the measurements of various air pollutants.
- 'TEMP', 'PRES', 'DEWP', 'RAIN': These columns represent the measurements of temperature, pressure, dew point, and rainfall, respectively.
- 'wd': This column represents the wind direction.
- 'WSPM': This column represents the wind speed.
- 'station': This column may indicate the specific monitoring station where the measurements were taken.

The EDA process likely involved exploring and analyzing the relationships between these variables, understanding their distributions, identifying any patterns or trends over time, and finding potential correlations or dependencies among the different air quality factors.

By detailing the columns and their meanings, the explanation provides a clearer understanding of the dataset and the information that was explored during the EDA process.
